multi-server-sync
=================

This is a module developed for a client.  The client has multiple servers with SS cms installed. What it does is synchronize the assets uploaded from a server to the other servers.  It means that when you upload a file using the SS file manager, the uploaded file will also be uploaded to the other servers.

Not yet a clean version but works for me. :)
